# Introduction

## Objective and Scope

-   **Objective**: Provide a walk-through of the [Labstats.ca](Labstats.ca "Labstats.ca") reporting template (Excel xlsx file format)

-   **Scope**: Applicable to all laboratories participating in a [Labstats.ca](Labstats.ca "Labstats.ca") Proficiency Test

::: callout-note
Signup information and program details are available at [Labstats.ca](Labstats.ca "Labstats.ca")

## Accessing the Reporting Template

-   After login on [Labstats.ca](Labstats.ca "Labstats.ca"), the reporting template is available for download in the 'Shared' folder of 'Participant info & results'

![](images/download-template.PNG){width="512"}

## Version Control

-   Each sample round will use a dedicated version of the Reporting Template
-   Template version is specified on Row 3 of the **Read_Me** worksheet:

![](images/template-version.PNG)

## Filename

-   The downloaded reporting template will have a file name in this format:

    -   **LabID-20240422_Data_Reporting_LabName_raw.xlsx**

-   Open the reporting template, change to the Lab_ID worksheet

    -   Find the Lab_ID number that corresponds with your lab. Send us an e-mail ( LabStats\@ocwa.com ) if you cannot locate your lab

-   Close the reporting template

-   Edit the file name in Windows to replace the 'LabID' with your Lab_ID number from above and change the 'Labname' to an abbreviation for your lab name

    -   E.g. **99-20240422_Data_Reporting_OCWA_raw.xlsx**
    
::: callout-tip
Record your lab ID number in a convenient location to avoid looking it up for future PT rounds.

## Structure of Reporting Template

-   Open the reporting template .xlsx file that you just renamed

::: callout-tip
The template is structured for worksheets to be populated sequentially.
:::

-   Both qPCR and dPCR specific worksheets are present by default, it is suggested to hide worksheets of a platform you are not submitting results for simplicity

    -   For example, to hide the dPCR_QC_Data worksheet, right-click and select 'Hide'

# Worksheets

## Read_Me

-   Read_Me is the first worksheet and provides a name key and colour reference

![](images/read_me.PNG){width="820"}

## Lab_ID

-   Fill out your Lab_ID in cell C1 (same as used for the filename)

    -   Verify that the lab name in cell E1 is correct

![](images/lab_ID.PNG)

## Method_Summary

-   This worksheet is where the details of your methods are filled out starting with Method 1 in cell F9

![](images/method_code.PNG){width="842"}

::: callout-note
Do not use a different method code if the pre-analytical steps (i.e., concentration/extraction steps) are the same. For example, if two targets (PMMoV and SARS-CoV-2) are characterized from the SAME RNA extract, the method is regarded as the same and should be described in the same method column entry.
:::

-   Indicate the platform used for quantification in row 33 for each method (qPCR/dPCR/both)

## Std_Curve_Data (qPCR only)

-   For methods using qPCR, this sheet is where the dilution series data from your standard curve(s) are populated

-   Columns N through P are used to indicate if each dilution series point is used in your standard curve or not. In other words have any of the points chosen to be discarded keeping in mind the requirements from the [Ontario protocol](https://www.ontario.ca/page/protocol-analyzing-wastewater-samples) (Section 3)

## Std_Curve_Summary (qPCR only)

-   For methods using qPCR, this sheet is where parameters of the standard curves are reported

    -   Paired with the dilution series data reported on Std_Curve_Data

-   If a long term standard curve is used to quantify results, please indicate in the column 'Long-term_curve'

## ESV_CF_Calc

-   Effective sample volume (ESV) and concentration factor (CF) calculator

-   This calculator is optional but highly recommended to ensure that the ESV and CF are calculated correctly

::: callout-important
ESV is essential so that the reported concentration estimates are representative of the amount of the original wastewater sample that was actually analyzed.
:::

## qPCR_QC_Data

-   For methods using qPCR, this sheet is where quality control results are to be reported

-   See @sec-qualifier for details on completing the 'Qualifier' columns:

![](images/qualifier-columns.PNG)

## dPCR_QC_Data

-   For methods using dPCR, this sheet is where quality control results are to be reported

## qPCR_Sample_Data

-   For methods using qPCR, this sheet is where sample results and inhibition control data are to be reported

## dPCR_Sample_Data

-   For methods using dPCR, this sheet is where sample results and inhibition control data are to be reported

## Qualifier_Flowchart {#sec-qualifier}

-   Flowchart to assist with completing the technical replicate qualifier columns in the qPCR_QC_Data and qPCR_Sample_Data worksheets
